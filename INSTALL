PyKDE 5 currently requires the following:

* A recent Python (3.3.0 are what I've been testing with)

* SIP version 4.15.3 or later. (Earlier versions may or may not work.)
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/index.php

* PyQt 5.1.1 or later. Also available at Riverbank Computing.

* KDE Frameworks 5 and development headers etc.

Depending on how you work, you might want to install the extra python
modules into a separate Python interpreter installation. Make sure
that the Python interpreter that you want to use is the first one
found on your $PATH or explicitly specify a python executable as an
argument to cmake (option -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python etc).

By default, the supplied tools (pykdeuic4) are installed both as a
Python version depdendent name (e.g. pykdeuic4-2.7 for Python 2.7) and
a symlink to $BIN_INSTALL_DIR/pykdeuic4, but like Python's own "make
altinstall" this can be overriddent by passing -DPYKDEUIC4_ALTINSTALL=TRUE
to the CMake options: in such a case, only the version dependent name is
installed.

Once everything is built and installed, run the following in this
current directory as a test:

    python importTest.py

If the importTest.py works without any error messages, then your
installation is in good shape. Congratulations.
